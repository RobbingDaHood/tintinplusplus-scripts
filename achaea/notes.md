# TODO

1. Add list of healers and rotate between them, to decrease the load. 
1. Consider if the autohealing system needs to write a message every time I add a healer, could be spammy. 
1. Add autobuff setup: I did buff self setup, maybe just an alert for some important buffs: deter, unholy symbol and soften death
1. Add buff all pets
1. Add equip best items for all pets. 
    1. Put all not items in container
    1. reverse sort container
    1. get all items
    1. give all items to pet one
    1. order to wear all items
    1. order to drop all items
    1. get all
    1. repeat for each pet 
1. Add more crafting autos: Seems like it is the same lines being used multiple times, so make a catalog. 
    1. Could be great if it would keep the fire going and minimize use of matches. 
    1. Could be a "check crafting": Where it moves around and checks that everything is fine before starting. 
    1. Maybe it is only the fire that is needed. 
1. can I mark all forum notes as unread. Or at least a lot of old ones.
