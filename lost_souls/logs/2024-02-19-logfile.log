2024-02-19-16:01:06
2024-02-19-16:01:06    The Warbreakers are a long-forgotten elite cadre of operatives from the lost days of the Altrian Empire.  Equipped with shadow clones of the great sword Auldirfeng, these secretive agents were responsible for rooting out and destroying threats of any kind to the Empire, whether those threats were political, military, magickal, or even philosophical.  Focused on maintaining peace and stability within the Empire above all else, Warbreakers were trained in a wide array of skills from negotiation and etiquette to strategy and fieldcraft, equally capable of brokering a treaty, commanding an army, and fighting unaided against numerous foes with great skill and effectiveness.  In times of great extremity, Warbreakers were even capable infiltrators and assassins, willing and able to go to any lengths to protect peace within the Empire.
2024-02-19-16:01:06
2024-02-19-16:01:06    Now, many centuries after the fall of the Empire, the great sword Auldirfeng is once again active in the affairs of the realm.  Heedless of rumors of the Empire's so-called collapse, Auldirfeng has begun to rebuild the ranks of the Warbreakers, recruiting those in whose blood the power of the old Empire slumbers and once again bestowing the starshadow blades of the ancient legends.
2024-02-19-16:01:06
2024-02-19-16:01:06    As a Warbreaker, this duty has fallen to you, and Auldirfeng has granted you impressive powers as well as the ability to earn many more.  The awakened destinies and magicks within your bloodline grant you sight within darkness and strengthen your soul against death, and allow you to call upon Auldirfeng to summon a powerful weapon through which many other powers may be activated.  This blade is also capable of summoning a protective aura, which in turn possesses many unique capabilities of its own.

2024-02-19-16:01:15    [0mForemost among the powers granted to the Warbreakers is the ability to summon a manifestation of Auldirfeng's power, a sort of 'shadow copy' of the legendary blade.  Known to Warbreakers as a Starshadow Blade, this weapon serves as the badge of office for Warbreakers abroad within the Empire (or at least it did, back when the Empire actually existed in a meaningful sense).  In addition to functioning as a serviceable weapon, the blade can be used to draw forth aspects of Auldirfeng's power, enabling the wielder to produce supernatural effects of various types.  These effects take the form of maneuvers usable by Warbreakers whenever they have a Starshadow Blade equipped, and the strength of the effect is primarily dependent upon the summoner's expertise with skills related to the channeling, direction, focusing, and tuning of power from objects which respond to one's will.

2024-02-19-16:01:15    A Starshadow Blade cannot persist once out of its wielder's possession; a common tactic is for Warbreakers to drop or throw their blades as needed and resummon them as desired.  You may only have one Starshadow Blade present at a time.

2024-02-19-21:03:09
2024-02-19-21:03:09    Arbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of regional differences in prices for particular goods.  An illustrative example is that ice is cheap in the northlands, but precious in a desert.
2024-02-19-21:03:09
2024-02-19-21:03:09    By purchasing items that are available in ready supply at one location and transporting them to a location where they are scarce, the agent -- called an arbitrageur -- can profit from the price difference between those two locations.
2024-02-19-21:03:09
2024-02-19-21:03:09    In practice, the way arbitrage works is that merchants you meet may need certain goods they do not already possess -- just ask a merchant for an arbitrage opportunity, and they'll tell you what they need -- although some merchants may not need a particular item at a given point in time.
2024-02-19-21:03:09
2024-02-19-21:03:09    You can receive arbitrage opportunities from nearly any merchant, not just typical shopkeepers.
2024-02-19-21:03:09
2024-02-19-21:03:10    Merchants will generally give you a hint as to where the item they're after can be found, based on their specialist knowledge as traders, but it doesn't matter where you get it as long as it meets their specifications.

2024-02-19-21:25:42This is a belt made of [33mleather[0m.  The quality of its craftsmanship is good.  It bears an embossed sword set upon a recessed relief of a shield.  It bears a small brand in the shape of an L with two bars through the upright line.  You estimate its value at about twenty-two gold.  You are wearing it.  
2024-02-19-21:25:42    It is in perfect condition.  
2024-02-19-21:25:42    It is intermediate in size, and looks just about right to fit you.  It looks about nine and seventeen twentieths dimins long, about half a dimin wide, and less than a twentieth of a dimin tall.  It weighs about a fifth of a dekan.
