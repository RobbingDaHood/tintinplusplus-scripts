# Procedural realms

Super good. Turned based combat and crafting. Interesting character development. No scripting limits. 

Played this for many months at the end of 2023.

# 3 kingdoms

Did try it out and I think I got the wrong impression: 
1. I thought it were lacking: But it is intended 2 sec click. 
1. questing is a major part but you are allowed to get answers and there is a wiki with all/most answers. 

I did get the sense that there were many builds. So should likely get back to them at some point. 

# Aardwolf

Tried around 5 hours. 

It is very "goal" focused. Every area has a "goal" with a difficulty from 1-5. This can both be based on what to kill or some puzzle that needs to be solved. 

Likely the puzzles are great quality and the game is super polished, but it is just not something for me to do. Maybe I will get back to it later because I know what to expect.

There is some good stuff I should get back to.

Suprisingly there were no answers. 

# Lost Souls

Needs a mapper but else it looks like it could be very good. 

I used 2 days on the mapper and it still did not work :( 

They stated on their Discord the GMCP is planned soon: I think I will wait for that before coming back.
