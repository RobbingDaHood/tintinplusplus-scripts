## Best rage consumer

[MISSING ONE BOOK] assault                 30 strength              combat, battle             enemy      40 stamina  45   Rage consumer, single target, armor debuff (Very good consumer)

## 2 handed passives

heavy handed            38 strength              combat                                                 2 hand, passive, damage, crit and less stamina use (Must have)
follow through          14 strength              combat                                                 Passive, 2 handed damage, some crit (Must have)

## Weapon mastery

If a lot of dodge:
axe mastery             8 strength               combat                                                 Anti dodge, Passive

Else:
polearm mastery         12 strength              combat                                                 Passive, crit 
Polearms are lighter than axes, gives the same amount of damage over time
I think it has to be polearms. 

Just because we need 2 handed weapons. 

## Other great skill

pommel strike           4 strength               combat                                8 stamina        Passive, more damage

## About crit

We have no or very little agillity, so maybe we do not have much crit. If we do then we can change build over time

There is quite a lot of crit skills and passives already.
