There are 6 heals * 3 levels = 18 ranks. 
3 of them is before 20 spirit
Getting "holy might" needs to be great! Else it is not worth all 20 points. I can easily respec later.

# Ability 

Strength 20
Agility 7 (to get sneak) 
Rest in Spirit to get the above bonus 

# Armor

Chain gives a bit of focus, but Plate gives a armor boost: Like twice the armor. 

The cleric does not need to cast during the battle, if he just uses attacks and maintains the buffs. So maybe plate is better. 

Long term I the cleric would not have enough Strength to go plate AND if "Holy might" is not good enough, then i should go full Spririt/chain. 

Maybe I will craft some Chain just because I can respec easier later in that case.
