# Ideas for script

1. Cant handle multiple trees in the same room
    1. It does work sometimes
1. Handle walking over the edge. The walk command cant do the wrap around the world. 
1. Get all help files and maybe the notes on the world. 
1. Craft and repair until X have been crafted. 
1. Make a crafting queue so i do not need to do each step. Likely a bit tricky because needing different stations. 
1. Dump loot; I already dump everything the same place. Should be simple. Dump all salvageable in one place. 
1. Using Survey to improve autoexplore
