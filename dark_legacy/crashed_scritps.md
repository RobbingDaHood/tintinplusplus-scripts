That crashed har at startup if miner_fullauto_v2 were active. 

I am trying to move the char a bit and try again .

Strange that it had run for many hours the day before with no issue. 

I tried to revert the last weeks changes and it still crashed. 

So must be some old code that bugged out hard.

Seems like it is they waypoint line that gives some issue. will try to move away from that.
